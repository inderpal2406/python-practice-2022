# python-practice-2022

## w3resource practice problems
- The motto is to develop python programs for the problems stated on this [website](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/)
- As of now, the 150 problems from the part-1 of [basic problems](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) are being practised.
- The numbering of the scripts is done as per the problem number on the website.
- Mutiple scripts relating to same topic/problem are named with same problem numbers with addition of a,b,c, etc in the name to denote the difference and the relation.
- The numbers missing in the script numbering are the problems which are skipped for now due to lack of knowledge. These will be worked upon as time progresses.
